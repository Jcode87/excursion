# excursion

Created a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” Used a combination of HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub. 

The web page built advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so
I used video and landscape imagery to set the scene. 
Landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal was to entice potential customers into using the product.
